From the top to bottom of the Galaxy Chart, several words are written in an
alien language:

\texttt{HFR PBQR JBEQ EBOBG NG YBJRE YRSG FGNE GB FBYIR UVQQRA CHMMYR}

By applying the ROT-13 cipher to all these words, the following message
is revealed:

\texttt{USE CODE WORD ROBOT AT LOWER LEFT STAR TO SOLVE HIDDEN PUZZLE}

In ClueKeeper, this can be solved by using the ``LOADING...'' clue that
appears partway into the game.
