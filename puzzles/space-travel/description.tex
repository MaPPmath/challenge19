Zounds! Your ship has intercepted an extraterrestrial message that seems 
to be instructions for space travel.
Your communications officer says that the message translates
to ``SWEATED''... ``MATT''?... ``URNS''?!

Well, that certainly doesn't seem to be useful information.  
The numbers might indicate locations, but locations of what?
