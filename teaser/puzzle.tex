\begin{customPuzzle}{~}{Getting on\\Top of Things}{HSC16 Teaser}
  Your friend has recently been talking about this field of math called
  \textbf{topology}. Something about donuts and coffee cups being the same
  thing? You don't know, but you tell yourself you'll look it up on Wikipedia
  later.

  She's also into \textbf{puzzles}, so it's no surprise when she hands you
  three scraps of paper with a bunch of weird letters.

  ``Did you know topology can be useful in OCR -''
  (\textbf{optical character recognition})
  ``- techniques? Using this font, you can make five groups of five
  topologically equivalent letters. See, the A and the G are both
  drawn as a single loop with a curve sticking out.''

  ``Anyway, we're looking for one more player on our school's
  \textbf{MaPP High School Challenge} team.
  I put the location of our next team meeting in that puzzle.
  Figure it out and I'll see you there!''

  \textit{
  Decipher your friend's message by first filling the grid of letters so
  that each row has ``topologically equivalent'' letters and is ordered
  alphabetically. \textbf{Teams that turn in a correct solution to this puzzle
  at MaPP HSC16 registration will get a head-start on solving the opening
  challenge!}
